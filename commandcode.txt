Branching and Merging using Git:

//To check all branches 
git branch

//To create new branch
git branch "branch name"

//to switch to a new branch or another branch
git checkout "branch name"

//To merge the changes of the new branch with the master branch
git merge "name of other branch"

//To delete a branch after it had been merged with the master branch
git branch -d "name of branch"
//Use capital D for file that have not been merged
git branch -D "name of branch"

//To add a file that you do not want to show up when you push your work to a public repository or //when you stage it
create a file called .gitignore
then include the name of the file that you do not want to show up.
Example: do not show this file 
            keys.txt
